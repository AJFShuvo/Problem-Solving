## üìñ Overview

This repository contains my solutions for **Module-1, Contest-4**, focused on mastering **Arrays**, one of the most fundamental data structures in programming.  
The problems in this contest help strengthen:

- Understanding of 1D arrays  
- Array traversal and manipulation  
- Frequency counting and searching  
- Basic logic building using arrays  
- Solving edge cases and constraints in array problems
- Frequency of elements in the Array
- Counting Odd/Even elements in the Array
- Sum of Odd/Even elements in the Array 
- Cyclic Array rotation 
- Indexed array summation 
- Adjacent Element Difference Check (scanning the array to find the first consecutive pair whose absolute    difference does not exceed a given threshold).
- Constraint Validation on Array Elements(Non-decreasing order check, Range check, Divisibility check).
- Maximum of the Strictly Increasing Prefix
- Subarray(Segment) Swapping 
- Perfect-Square Sum check
- Uniform-Digit Pair counting
- Frequency Counting to Find the Missing Element
- Missing Number
- Greedy Maximization of Array Product by a Single Increment. 
- Frequency Counting with Trheshold Check
- Consecutive Range Expansion 
- Finding Missing Values via Boolean Marking 
- Presence-Flag Array for enumerating Missing values 
- Range Clamping( Limiting or bouding values to fixed interval)
- Difference Array Construction (discrete derivative of an array)
- Element Existence Check 


All problems are curated to build a solid foundation for solving real-world problems using arrays.
