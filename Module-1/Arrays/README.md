## üìñ Overview

This repository contains my solutions for **Module-1, Contest-4**, focused on mastering **Arrays**, one of the most fundamental data structures in programming.  
The problems in this contest help strengthen:

- Understanding of 1D arrays  
- Array traversal and manipulation  
- Frequency counting and searching  
- Basic logic building using arrays  
- Solving edge cases and constraints in array problems

All problems are curated to build a solid foundation for solving real-world problems using arrays.
