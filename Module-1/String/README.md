## üìñ Overview

This repository contains my solutions for **Module-1, Contest-5**, focused on mastering **String**, one of the most fundamental data structures in programming.  
The problems in this contest help strengthen:

- Understanding of String  
- String traversal and manipulation  
- Frequency counting and searching  
- Basic logic building using arrays  
- Solving edge cases and constraints in String problems
- Frequency of elements in the Array
- Counting vowels and consonent in the String
- Cyclic String rotation  
- Adjacent Element Difference Check (scanning the array to find the first consecutive pair whose absolute    difference does not exceed a given threshold).
- Constraint Validation on String Elements(Non-decreasing order check, Range check, Divisibility check).


All problems are curated to build a solid foundation for solving real-world problems using String.
