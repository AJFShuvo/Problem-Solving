## üìñ Overview

This repository contains my solutions for **Module-3, Contest-6**, focused on mastering **Brute Force** techniques applied to arrays and strings.  
The problems in this contest help strengthen:

- Understanding of brute force algorithms  
- Nested loop traversals for arrays and strings  
- Naive pattern searching and matching in strings  
- Exhaustive checks for array subsets and pairs  
- Basic logic building using iterative approaches  
- Solving edge cases and constraints with brute force methods  
- Frequency counting with multiple passes  
- Checking all possible rotations or shifts in arrays and strings  
- Adjacent and non-adjacent element comparisons (e.g., finding pairs with specific differences)  
- Constraint validation through complete enumeration (e.g., all elements checks, sum validations).

All problems are curated to build a solid foundation for understanding when and how to apply brute force in real-world array and string problems, emphasizing efficiency trade-offs for smaller constraints.
